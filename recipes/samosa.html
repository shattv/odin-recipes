    <h1>Samosa is a cassava or plantain-based dish often served with soup</h1>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cassava roots</li>
        <li> 5 yellow plantains </li>
        <li>2 cups of butter</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cassava and unpeeled plantains into a large pot. Fill with enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook until cassava is soft, about 30 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard plantain peels from plantains. Mash cassava and plantains with butter, then beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Use as much butter as needed to get the mixture moist enough to blend.</li>
